# Divarban (ÿØ€åŸàÿßÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÜ) - Real-time Ad Notifier for Divar
Divarban is an open-source Android application designed to help you stay updated with the latest advertisements on Divar (ÿØ€åŸàÿßÿ±), a popular classifieds platform. It actively monitors a specific Divar category URL (including your applied filters) that you provide and sends you a notification the moment a new ad is posted, ensuring you never miss out on a new listing.
This project was developed with a "vibe coding" approach.

## üåü Features

* **Precise URL Monitoring**: Input the exact Divar category URL, complete with any filters you've applied, for targeted tracking.
* **Single URL Focus**: Monitors one specific URL at a time to ensure dedicated attention to your chosen search.
* **Customizable Refresh Interval**: Set how frequently (in seconds) the app checks for new advertisements.
* **Instant Notifications**: Receive an immediate notification on your Android device when a new ad matching your criteria is found.
* **Seamless Divar Integration**: Clicking a notification directly opens the relevant ad in the official Divar application for quick viewing and interaction.

1.  **Install the App**: Download and install Divarban from the link above.
2.  **Configure**:
    * Open Divarban.
    * **Input the Divar URL**: Go to the Divar website or app, select your desired category, and apply any filters (e.g., price range, specific keywords, location). Copy the complete URL from your browser's address bar or use Divar's share functionality to get the link. Paste this full URL into Divarban.
    * **Set Refresh Interval**: Define the time interval (e.g., every 30 seconds, 60 seconds) at which Divarban should check for new ads.
    * **Important**: Divarban can only monitor **one URL at a time**.
3.  **Monitor**: The app will then periodically scan the provided URL in the background.
4.  **Get Notified**: If a new ad is published that appears on that URL, Divarban will send a push notification to your device.
5.  **View Ad**: Tapping the notification will launch the official Divar app (if the URL is a Divar ad link) or your browser to take you directly to the new ad.
